# MCQ Generator using LangChain + OpenAI

## Project Overview
This project is a **Multiple-Choice Question (MCQ) Generator** that uses **OpenAIâ€™s GPT models** (via LangChain) to automatically generate quizzes from input text or documents such as PDFs.  
It can extract text, generate questions, provide answer choices, and identify the correct answer.
